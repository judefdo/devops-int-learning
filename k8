QoS - Quality of Service
        1- Guartee --> when memory limit and request are same
        2- Burstable --> when memory limit is more than the request 
        3- Besteffort --> if you don't specify any limit on the pod definition

Defaulf definition: 
       you can specify a yml with limitRange like
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: LimitRange
        metadata:
            name: mem-limit-range
        spec:
            limits:
            - default:
                  memory: 512Mi
            defaultRequest:
                  memory: 256Mi
            type: Container

A Daemon set is a set of pods that runs only once on a host. 
They are used for host layer attributes like a network or for monitoring a network,
 which you may not need to run on a host more than once.

A Heapster is a performance monitoring and metrics collection system for data collected by the Kublet. 
This aggregator is natively supported and runs like any other pod within a Kubernetes cluster, 
which allows it to discover and query usage data from all nodes within the cluster.

The controller manager is a daemon that is used for embedding core control loops, garbage collection, and Namespace creation. 
It enables the running of multiple processes on the master node even though they are compiled to run as a single process.

The primary controller managers that can run on the master node are the 
endpoints controller, service accounts controller, namespace controller, node controller, token controller, and replication controller.

Kubernetes uses etcd as a distributed key-value store for all of its data, including metadata and configuration data, 
and allows nodes in Kubernetes clusters to read and write data. Although etcd was purposely built for CoreOS, 
it also works on a variety of operating systems (e.g., Linux, BSB, and OS X) because it is open-source. 
Etcd represents the state of a cluster at a specific moment in time and is a canonical hub for state management and 
cluster coordination of a Kubernetes cluster.
